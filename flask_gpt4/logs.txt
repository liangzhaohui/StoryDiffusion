2023-08-25 01:05:24: 01 On a walk through the park, Marco stumbles across a teddy bear fallen on the side of the path.

02 Realizing it must be lost, he uses his mobile phone to photograph it where he found it, and takes the bear home.

03 Once home, Marco uploads the photo to iFound*. The Mapltl function uses the GPS from the photo to record where the bear was found

04 As soon as the iFound match list is generated, Marco sees a photo of the very same bear he has just found. He immediately contacts the finder and they arrange a way to get the bear back to its owner.

05 The teddy bear is handed off to a very relieved mom.

06 When it is recorded that the bear has made it safely home, Marco receives a 'thank you' email from ifound, offering him a choice of coupons for anything form ice cream to flowers. Marco's choice provides useful information to corporate sponsors.
